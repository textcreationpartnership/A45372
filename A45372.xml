         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BEing Importuned by ſome Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; whoſe curioſity invited them to ſee the Paradice at the two wreathed Poſts in Sho-Lane (where their Satisfaction could not be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their own eyes) to publiſh ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the excellency of it, that ſo the deſerved honour of the incomparable <hi>Artiſt,</hi> may be more generally known, not only to his bare Fame, but alſo to his profit, toward the incouragement of his worthy Labours, I have been induced to ſet forth this Paper, to recommend this Elegant and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous piece of Art to all Noble and Ingenuous Perſons.</p>
            <p>The Deſign, is a Model, or Repreſentation of that Beautifull Proſpect <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradice, when the whole Creation of <hi>Animals,</hi> were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſubjected to his imperious eye, and from his mouth received their ſeveral names, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by them to thoſe particular ſubſervient Offices whereunto by Nature they were Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:31544:4"/>
            <p>The <hi>Artiſt</hi> hath ſo far complied with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and exact Original, as is poſſible to humane skill and induſtry. His reſearches and enquiries after Foraign, Outlandiſh Creatures, whoſe names are not ſo well known to theſe Quarters of the World (and thoſe ſmall and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ones too) was a coſtly Labour; but to preſent them to view in their natural ſhapes and poſtures to the Life, and beyond all former Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Deſcriptions of them, as that every man may be as wiſe as <hi>Adam,</hi> and read their names and qualities in their Aſpects, is a moſt meritorious obliging Work.</p>
            <p>To enumerate all the Creatures (ſo as they ſeem here enlivened) by name, were a tedious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent task, only thus much ſhall ſuffice: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the moſt unbounded and comprehenſive knowledge of any man ſince <hi>Adam</hi> did attain to in the Science of the Number and Form of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is certainly outdone in this Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For here they are placed from the greateſt to the leaſt, from the Elephant to the Mouſe, from the Eagle to the Wren, from the Crocodile to the Glow-Worm; with all ſorts or kinds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, and Creeping things, to pleaſe the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes of the Spectators.</p>
            <p>One would wonder upon a long and continued view, that the Creatures of different natures and antipathies to one another, as the Dog and the Bear, the Lion and the wild Boar; and thoſe ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>Animals,</hi> which exerciſe hoſtility, and among
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31544:4"/>whom, one with another there is ſuch conſtant feuds, as Cocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould ſtand ſo ſtill and quiet, and not flie one upon another; certainly, the leaſt Mathematical motion, would breed ſuch a War in this Commonwealth of Beaſts, that would utterly undo the better deſerving <hi>Artiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt have a ſpecial care (whoever ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf his innocent pleaſure of ſeeing theſe Rarities) that as ſoon as you enter, you fix your eye firſt on the Baſilisk, placed conveniently for that advantage, leſt her venemous ſight ſpy you out before, and ſo a ſtrong conceit that ſhe is there in life, endanger yours.</p>
            <p>You cannot without indignation of minde ſee the accurſed Serpent putting the deadly Apple into our Grand mother <hi>Eves</hi> hand: and were it not that this malicious fraud is acted at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt end of the Room; and out of your reach, you would put forth your hand to prevent that deſtruction (which enſued thereby upon Poſterity) A fraud, I ſay, twice ſo (ill and well) practiſed, firſt by the Serpent, and then by this our <hi>Artiſt,</hi> that the one can never be remedied, nor the other mended.</p>
            <p>There is alſo the divertiſement of <hi>Hawking,</hi> in the ſeveral Flights of the <hi>Taſſel,</hi> the <hi>Lanner,</hi> the <hi>Marlyn,</hi> and that merry ſport of the <hi>Hobby;</hi> but I know not by what new or ill quality, they neither come down with their Quarry, nor will they come to Lure at any hand; the Spaniels ſtand diligently at the retrive, eagerly expecting a ſhare of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31544:5"/>Game, and would bark, but dare not for their lives, but y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>u would ſwear they meant it, and that they are abuſed.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo ſundry Rarities of Trees, Slips of thoſe beauteous bulks, which grew in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> upon the fruit whereof (<hi>Zeuxis</hi> Maſter ſhip being here infinitely ſurmounted and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) ſtand Birds picking, to the envy of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Spectators, who thinks thoſe Delicacies were ordained for them, while their gallants are ready to huſh them off the Trees with their Hat and Feathers.</p>
            <p>While we are ſpeaking of ſuch Perſonages, give me leave to mention a piece of excellent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht <hi>Art,</hi> relating to them: On the left ſide of the Room, are five beautifull Ladies ſeated, beholding theſe curioſities, a perſon of quality ſtanding by them, attended with three Blackmore Lacquees in rich blew Liveries: At the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, the livelineſs, beauty and gallantry of them hath ſtruck ſuch a kind of Reverence, that many have conſtantly and obſervantly bowed towards them, and have wondred at the non-return of their Civility.</p>
            <p>On the left ſide behind the opening of the door are placed a Conſort of Muſitians of commonly known faces. among the reſt the <hi>Artiſt,</hi> tuning of a Lute, all ſo exact and to the Life, that people on a ſudden glance, ſuppoſe they ſhall have Muſick too, as in other Shows and Plays, for their money. But that which excels therein, is the draught of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31544:5"/>the old man of the Houſe, filling out drink to the Muſicians, ſo proportionably and rarely Copied, that it is very hard to diſtinguiſh betwixt them, which is the livelier,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Th' Old man and's Picture, both to' life,</l>
               <l>Together ſet to end the ſtrife,</l>
               <l>Or both will falſe and feigned ſeem,</l>
               <l>Or both you'l true and real deem.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Nay ſo compleatly hath the <hi>Artiſt</hi> done this piece, that when firſt he placed him in the Room, the Old man having conducted ſome Gentlemen thither, and while they were beholding the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Rarities gone out again; when the Show was done there; and the <hi>Artiſt</hi> was to ſhut the door, he eſpied, as he though, the old man, and deſired his Picture inſtead of him to come out, that he might lock the ſaid door, till recollecting himſelf, he found out his happy and almoſt indiſcoverable Errour.</p>
            <p>When you have glutted your eyes even to ſatiety here, there remains yet a Collation below ſtairs which will amount to the juſt meaſure of a large entertainment: Tis the Repreſentation, What do I call it? Tis the very ſelf ſame Feaſt that luxurious Emperour <hi>Heliagabalus</hi> made for his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who diſappointing his Invitation, it hath been preſerved in <hi>Art</hi> to this time; you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nor to fall to, becauſe that great Maſter of the Beaſt hath nor as yet touched one Diſh of it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31544:6"/>all that choice variety, and keep your ſtomach for it, whether it be Chine of Beef, <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Veniſon, or Daintier Viands, Hollow Birds, Pies, Tarts, &amp;c. But if you ſhould chance to faſt over long (as I do not promiſe you any ſet Meal time) there is a remedy at hand, you may kiſs the Cook Maid; but let not her ſmug and black eyes entice you any further.</p>
            <p>After all this comes a Banquet (tis not for a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine palate, and therefore I ſhall not inſiſt upon thoſe ſweet Kickſhaws) there is nothing wanting here, to ſerve a Ladies deſire, and to keep it; for its twenty to one if her eye be not bigger then her belly.</p>
            <p>Upon a review of the whole, and ſecond thoughts, it ſeems to me to be the Model of the Ark, into which all the Creatures againſt the approach of the Deluge entred for their preſervation: The Proviſion in the Room below-ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
